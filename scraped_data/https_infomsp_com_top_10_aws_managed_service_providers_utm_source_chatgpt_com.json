Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is one of these services, which allows users to have a virtual cluster of computers available at all times through the Internet. Virtual computers on AWS have hardware central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing, local/RAM memory, hard-disk/SSD storage, a choice of operating systems, networking, and pre-loaded application software like web servers, databases, and customer relationship management. The Amazon subsidiary maintains the AWS technology, which is used in server farms all around the world. Fees are determined by a combination of consumption (a “Pay-as-you-go” model), hardware, operating system, software, or networking characteristics selected by the subscriber, as well as availability, redundancy, security, and service options.

Virtual computers on AWS have hardware central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing, local/RAM memory, hard-disk/SSD storage, a choice of operating systems, networking, and pre-loaded application software like web servers, databases, and customer relationship management. The Amazon subsidiary maintains the AWS technology, which is used in server farms all around the world. Fees are determined by a combination of consumption (a “Pay-as-you-go” model), hardware, operating system, software, or networking characteristics selected by the subscriber, as well as availability, redundancy, security, and service options.

The Solution Architect from Cloudnexa will assess the present state of the organization's systems to decide how the optimum solution may be implemented in the cloud. The evaluation might be done on an existing solution or a new one that hasn't been installed yet. This process will entail collaboration with all business stakeholders to ensure that the end result best matches their clients' resources and skill sets.
