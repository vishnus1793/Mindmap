It is an immunoglobulin E (IgE)–mediated reaction to allergens like dust mites, pet dander, cockroaches, molds, and pollens. Symptoms include sneezing, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, cough, itching, sinus pressure, headache, and epistaxis. Although not life-threatening, allergic rhinitis can significantly impair quality of life and daily functioning. In children, it may contribute to sleep disturbances, poor school performance, and behavioral issues. [1] In adults, it can reduce workplace productivity by as much as 10%, though appropriate treatment may reduce this impact to around 3%. [2] The \"one airway hypothesis\" states that upper and lower airway inflammation are linked, meaning asthma and allergic rhinitis often co-occur. [3] Untreated allergic rhinitis in asthmatics increases ED visits by nearly twofold and hospitalizations by almost threefold. [4] Next: Epidemiology In the United States, the prevalence of allergic rhinitis in children is estimated at 10% to 20%. [5] One national survey reported rates as high as 38% when based on any symptom occurrence, but prevalence dropped to 17% when symptoms were required to persist longer than 31 days. [6] Similar rates are seen in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Allergic rhinitis often begins in early childhood. Sensitization to indoor allergens such as dust mites, pet dander, mold, and cockroach particles may occur before 2 years old, particularly with high exposure. Sensitization to outdoor allergens typically emerges after age 3–5 years. Symptoms tend to increase with age, peaking in adolescence or early adulthood, and may decrease later in life. In the PARIS cohort, 9.1% of toddlers showed allergic rhinitis–like symptoms by 18 months of age. [7] There is no clear sex or racial predilection in allergic rhinitis. However, children from non-White backgrounds may be less likely to receive a diagnosis or seek treatment. [8] Prevalence is generally higher in urban and suburban settings compared to rural areas. Allergic rhinitis frequently coexists with other atopic conditions, particularly asthma and atopic dermatitis. [1, 3] Children with allergic rhinitis are at increased risk of developing asthma, and early-onset rhinitis may precede asthma symptoms. Conjunctivitis is also common and may occur concurrently. Recognizing these associations is important for early diagnosis and comprehensive management of atopic disease in pediatric patients. Interestingly, some studies demonstrate that living with multiple pets in the first few years of life decreases the risk of asthma and allergies. [9] Previous Next: Nasal Function and Anatomy The nose filters, humidifies, and regulates the temperature of inspired air using a large surface area created by three turbinates in each nostril. Airflow resistance is affected by mucosal blood flow, which alters turbinate size. Nasal defenses include mucus, cilia, and vibrissae that trap inhaled particles. While irritants such as cigarette smoke or cold air may cause short-term rhinitis, allergens can trigger a more sustained immune response. Commonly, one nostril is slightly more obstructed than the other due to the nasal cycle, a normal physiological process where the turbinates in each nostril swell and shrink in an alternating pattern. This alternates the dominant side of airflow every few hours. [10] Previous Next: Etiology Allergic rhinitis symptoms arise from exposure to environmental allergens, which can be classified as perennial (year-round) or seasonal. Perennial allergens are typically indoor and include: Dust mites Cat dander Dog dander Indoor molds Cockroaches Feathers (usually allergenic due to dust mite contamination in feather bedding) Other furry animals Nonwashable bedding, such as pillows and mattresses, often harbors dust mites, which reproduce every three weeks and thrive where human dander accumulates. Dust mite–proof encasings are recommended to reduce exposure. Seasonal allergens are airborne and generally outdoor, with peak levels in late afternoon and early morning. These include: Tree pollen Grass pollen Weed pollen (note: flowers do not cause allergic rhinitis because they rely on insect pollination, not wind) Outdoor mold spores Previous Next: Pathophysiology Allergic rhinitis is an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to environmental allergens. Sensitization requires repeated exposure, which rarely occurs before age 2 years for indoor allergens and typically begins after age 3–5 years for outdoor allergens. The average age at presentation is 9–10 years. [6] Once sensitized, allergen exposure causes cross-linking of allergen-specific IgE on the surface of mast cells. This leads to degranulation and the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, prostaglandin D2, leukotrienes, tryptase, heparin, and various cytokines. [11, 12] These mediators produce two phases of response: Immediate-phase symptoms include nasal itching, sneezing, clear rhinorrhea, and congestion Late-phase response occurs hours later due to recruitment of eosinophils and basophils that release additional inflammatory mediators, prolonging symptoms In highly sensitive individuals, repeated exposure can lead to nasal priming. [12] The mucosa becomes hyperresponsive and reacts to even small amounts of allergen or nonspecific triggers. Previous Next: Prognosis Allergic rhinitis is not associated with mortality, but it causes significant morbidity and impairs quality of life. Patients often report symptoms such as nasal congestion, sneezing, and poor sleep that interfere with daily activities. Quality-of-life studies have shown that individuals with moderate to severe allergic rhinitis rate their impairment as comparable to that experienced by patients with moderate to severe asthma. In children, allergic rhinitis is a leading cause of missed school days, with an estimated 824,000 school days lost annually in the United States. [13] In addition, more than 4 million days of reduced function are reported each year due to allergic rhinitis–related symptoms. [13] The condition is also strongly associated with comorbid atopic and upper airway disorders, including asthma, atopic dermatitis, sinusitis, and otitis media. [1] Most patients can manage symptoms effectively with intermittent or continuous pharmacotherapy. Allergen immunotherapy is the only intervention that can modify the disease course, though symptoms often recur 2–3 years after discontinuation, typically with reduced severity. [14] A small percentage of children improve during adolescence, but many experience a recurrence in early adulthood. Symptoms usually diminish by the fifth decade of life. The economic burden of allergic rhinitis is substantial. Although data currently available are limited, the latest estimates put US self-treatment spending at about $56 per year per patient, global prescription costs above $6 billion, and indirect productivity losses near $1.5 billion.
