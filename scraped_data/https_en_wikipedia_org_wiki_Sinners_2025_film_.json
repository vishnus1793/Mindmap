Jordan in dual roles as criminal twin brothers who return to their hometown where they are confronted by a supernatural evil. It co-stars Hailee Steinfeld, Miles Caton (in his film debut), Jack O'Connell, Wunmi Mosaku, Jayme Lawson, Omar Miller, and Delroy Lindo. Coogler began developing the film through his production company Proximity Media, with Jordan cast in the lead role. The project was announced in January 2024, and after a bidding war, Warner Bros. Pictures acquired distribution rights the following month. Additional roles were cast in April. Principal photography took place from April to July 2024. Longtime Coogler collaborator Ludwig Göransson composed the film's score and served as an executive producer. Sinners premiered on April 3, 2025, at AMC Lincoln Square in New York City,[11] and was theatrically released in United States on April 18, 2025, by Warner Bros. Pictures.[12] The film received critical acclaim and grossed $365.9 million worldwide. Plot[edit] In 1932, identical twins and World War I veterans Elijah \"Smoke\" and Elias \"Stack\" Moore return to Clarksdale, Mississippi, having spent seven years working for the Chicago Outfit. Using money stolen from gangsters, they purchase a sawmill from landowner Hogwood to start a juke joint for the local Black community. Their cousin Sammie, an aspiring guitarist, joins them despite his pastor father Jedidiah's warnings about the sins of blues music. The twins recruit pianist Delta Slim as a performer, local Chinese shopkeeper couple Grace and Bo Chow as suppliers, field worker Cornbread as a bouncer, and Smoke's estranged wife Annie as a cook. Annie believes her Hoodoo practices kept the twins safe, but Smoke doubts them for not preventing their infant daughter's death. Stack runs into his white-passing ex-girlfriend Mary, who resents him for abandoning her out of protection. Elsewhere, Irish-immigrant vampire Remmick shelters from Choctaw vampire hunters with a married Klansmen couple, whom he turns into vampires. On the joint's opening night, Sammie, Delta Slim, and Pearline – a singer with whom Sammie becomes enamored – perform on stage. Sammie's music is transcendent, unknowingly summoning spirits of both past and future to join the crowd. However, the performance also attracts Remmick and his minions, who offer money and music in exchange for entry. A suspicious Smoke refuses. The twins realize that their patrons' reliance on company scrip makes it impossible for the joint to be profitable. Reasoning with Stack that outside income is necessary, Mary meets Remmick outside, but is bitten. Returning inside, she seduces and fatally bites Stack. Sammie and Smoke discover them; Smoke shoots Mary, but she is unaffected and escapes. Outside, Remmick turns Cornbread. Smoke closes the joint early; as the patrons and Bo leave, the vampires turn them. Stack revives as a vampire, but flees after Annie repels him with pickled garlic juice. Annie realizes their assailants are vampires and tells the survivors how to deter and defeat them and that killing Remmick will not revert the others back into humans. Although Remmick and his vampires share a hive mind, their personalities remain intact. Still unable to enter the joint, Remmick tries to negotiate by inviting the survivors to join him, saying that vampirism offers immortality and freedom from persecution. He promises to leave in exchange for Sammie, whose musical skills he wants to use to summon the spirits of his lost community, also revealing that Hogwood heads the local Klan and plans to attack the joint at dawn. They refuse, and Remmick threatens to attack the Chows' daughter Lisa at their home. Enraged by the threat, Grace invites the vampires into the joint, and a fight ensues. Grace, Bo, Annie, and Delta Slim are killed, while Mary escapes and Remmick turns Pearline. Smoke fights and defeats Stack, then stakes Remmick before he can bite Sammie. As the sun rises, the vampires are incinerated by its light. Smoke sends Sammie home before he kills Hogwood and his men, but is fatally shot. He reunites with Annie and their daughter after dying. Meanwhile, Sammie disregards his father's pleas to seek salvation and travels to Chicago. In 1992, an elderly Sammie, now a successful blues musician, is visited by an ageless Stack and Mary after performing at his blues club. Stack reveals that Smoke spared him at the joint on the condition that Sammie live in peace. After declining the couple's offer of immortality, Sammie performs for them. As they depart, Sammie admits that despite being haunted by that night, before the sun went down, it was the greatest day of his life. Stack wistfully agrees, as it was the last time he saw Smoke or the sun, and the only time they were all truly free. Cast[edit] Michael B.

Jordan (2019), and composer Ludwig Göransson (2018). In January 2024, an untitled period film (rumored to take place in the Jim Crow-era South and involve the undead) from writer, director and producer Ryan Coogler was reported to be in development through his production company Proximity Media, with longtime collaborator Michael B. Jordan cast in the lead role.[15][16] Sony Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Universal Pictures were in a bidding war to acquire the distribution rights to the film, which carried a budget of around $90 million.[17] According to The Hollywood Reporter, Warner Bros. greenlit the film with a production budget of $80 million, but the final budget climbed to $100 million.[4] In exchange for the distribution rights to the film, Coogler was asking studios for first-dollar gross, final cut privilege, and ownership of the film twenty-five years after its release.[18] The following month, Warner Bros. won the distribution rights to the film by acceding to Coogler's terms.[16] Coogler cited the films of Quentin Tarantino, Jordan Peele, Christopher Nolan (who is given an on-screen special thanks credit), Francis Ford Coppola, Brian De Palma, Spike Lee and the Metallica song \"One\" as sources of inspiration.[19][20] In April 2024, Jack O'Connell was cast as the film's villain.[21] Delroy Lindo, Jayme Lawson, Omar Benson Miller, Hailee Steinfeld, Li Jun Li and Lola Kirke were cast in undisclosed roles.[22] Wunmi Mosaku was cast as Smoke's love interest.[23] Yao, Miles Caton, Peter Dreimanis, and Christian Robinson were added the next month.[24][25] Halsey would audition for the role that went to Steinfeld.[26] Machine Gun Kelly was offered the opportunity to audition for the role that went to Peter Dreimanis but he declined because he was not comfortable saying the n-word.[27] Principal photography began in New Orleans on April 14, 2024, under the working title Grilled Cheese, and wrapped on July 17.[28][29][30] It was shot by cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw on 65 mm film using a combination of IMAX 15-perf and Ultra Panavision 70 cameras[31] and scenes thus alternate between the 1.43:1 and 2.76:1 aspect ratios.[32][33][34] Kodak created a 65mm version of their Ektachrome 100D 5294 film stock specifically for the production, where it was used for a flashback sequence.[35] The production spent $67.6 million on-location in Louisiana.[36] The film's allocated budget was reported to have ultimately risen to around $100 million.[37][4] The film's production designer Hannah Beachler has acknowledged that the way the church in the film was designed included crossed beams that made the \"Wakanda Forever\" gesture and paid homage to the late Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman.[38][39] Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Storm Studios, Rising Sun Pictures, Base FX, Baraboom Studios, Light VFX and Outpost VFX provided the film's visual effects.[40][41] Some of the film's costumes were originally designed by Ruth E. Carter for the planned Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film Blade, but when production on it stalled Carter was approached by Coogler to work on the film. Given both films' shared time period and similar settings within the Prohibition era, Carter was able to reuse her research for Sinners and was allowed by Marvel Studios to buy costumes she made originally for Blade to be used on Sinners.[42] Music[edit] Main article: Sinners (soundtrack) Coogler's frequent collaborator Ludwig Göransson worked on the soundtrack of Sinners.[43] Göransson described Sinners as a personal and ambitious score, reflecting his own musical journey.[44] He drew inspiration from blues music and performed the score on a 1932 Dobro Cyclops resonator guitar, the same one Sammie carries throughout the film.[43][45] During the pre-production, Coogler sent Göransson several recordings from the 1930s and 1940s, particularly those of Robert Johnson and Tommy Johnson.[46] Göransson and Coogler insisted that Ludwig's wife Serena produce the songs. Serena Göransson, a classically trained violinist, said the southern Black music had to be handled with care and expert consultation and that she felt \"like a steward with this project [...] especially with the music. I just feel that it has a life of its own...\"[43] The couple worked with Lawrence \"Boo\" Mitchell, a blues producer who owns Royal Studios, and visited the B.B. King Museum and local juke joints in Clarksdale and Indianola with him for inspiration. The Göranssons and Mitchell recorded the songs at Royal Studios over five days with musicians such as Alvin Youngblood Hart and Cedric Burnside.[46] Mitchell also brought in other blues musicians such as Brittany Howard, Raphael Saadiq, Bobby Rush, Christone \"Kingfish\" Ingram and Buddy Guy (who also appears in the film).[46][47] The Göranssons rented a studio converted from a church in New Orleans, and worked with the supporting cast of Jack O'Connell, Lola Kirke, Peter Dreimanis and Jayme Lawson, rehearsing their songs multiple times. Much of the film was recorded live on set, with the cast members performing alongside other blues musicians.[43] Hailee Steinfeld wrote and recorded the original song \"Dangerous\" for the film.[48] Unlike most Warner Bros. films, which have soundtracks released through the company's in-house label WaterTower Music or record labels owned by Warner Music Group, the soundtrack and score to Sinners were released through Sony Music labels.[45] The soundtrack was released on Sony Masterworks on April 18, 2025, the same day as the film,[49] featuring 22 tracks performed by an array of blues musicians, alongside the cast members.[50][51] The lead single \"Sinners,\" performed by Rod Wave, was released two weeks prior.[45][52] Release[edit] Theatrical[edit] Sinners was released in the United States and Canada on April 18, 2025. It was previously scheduled for release on March 7, 2025, but was delayed to April (swapping dates with Mickey 17) to allow for more time needed in post-production due to the scarcity of film stock labs for the project, which heavily utilized film cameras.[53][54][55] In addition to a standard digital release, the film also received 10 IMAX 70 mm prints,[56][57] and 5 standard 70 mm prints.[58][59] In late May, the film was screened in Clarksdale, Mississippi, where it is set. Clarksdale does not have a working movie theater, but the civic auditorium hosted six showings, introduced by Coogler, Göransson, and other filmmakers. The town also hosted panels and Q&As related to the film over the three-day weekend festival.[60][61] AMC Theaters nationwide scheduled screenings of the film on Juneteenth at discounted prices.[62] Home media[edit] Sinners was released on digital streaming on June 3, 2025,[63] and on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on July 8, 2025.[64] It premiered on HBO Max on July 4, 2025.[65] Warner Bros. announced that Sinners would also be available to stream on HBO Max with interpretation in Black American Sign Language (BASL); the company stated that it was the first film to ever be offered by a streaming service with BASL.[66] Reception[edit] Box office[edit] As of July 22, 2025[update], Sinners has grossed $278.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $87.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $365.9 million.[5][6] Some publications said the film needed to gross $170–185 million to break-even when factoring in its production budget, Coogler's first-dollar gross, premium video-on-demand, and streaming deals with Prime and Netflix.[67][68] Other industry sources placed the break-even point at $200–225 million, with Puck going as high as $300 million, because of the film's budget, estimated $50–60 million marketing spend, and the presumption that theaters keep half of ticket sales.[69][70] Many fans of the film and industry figures like Ben Stiller criticized media coverage, specifically pieces from Variety, The New York Times, and Business Insider, that seemed to downplay the film's success by focusing on its box office performance, Coogler's salary, and speculation about its profitability.[71][72][73][74] In the United States and Canada, Sinners was projected to gross $30–40 million from 3,308 theaters in its opening weekend.[68][75] The film made $19.2 million on its first day, including an estimated $4.7 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $48 million, topping projections to finish first at the box office, upsetting Warner Bros.' own holdover A Minecraft Movie, which grossed $40.5 million in its third weekend.[67] The opening marked the best start for an original film since Jordan Peele's Us ($71 million in 2019), and the first time a studio had two films make more than $40 million each over a single weekend since 2009. Walk-up business, particularly on Saturday, and word-of-mouth contributed substantially to the opening, with 61% of attendees buying their ticket the same day.[67][76] Premium large format and IMAX screenings made up 45% of the opening.[77] Exit polling indicated that 47% of moviegoers bought tickets because of Jordan, 40% for Coogler, and 45% because of positive word-of-mouth, and that 64% of attendees were 35 or younger, with 46% being 25–34 and 2% under 18. The audience was 49% Black, 27% Caucasian, 14% Latino and Hispanic, 6% Asian, and 4% Native American/other, \"a strong turnout among different demographics\".[67][70][76][78] Sinners also made $15.4 million from 71 international markets, for a global opening weekend of $61 million.[79] Word-of-mouth momentum helped Sinners earn the second-best Monday haul for an R-rated horror film at $7.8 million, behind It ($8.6 million in 2017).[80] It ended its first week ahead of the seven-day totals of The Conjuring ($61.7 million in 2013) and Get Out ($49.8 million in 2017) with $77.5 million.[78] Sinners exceeded second weekend projections ($19.2–24 million)[81] to outgross new releases and top the box office again with $45.7 million. Its 4.9% drop is the third-best second-weekend performance for a film that debuted to more than $40 million after Shrek (+0.3% in 2001) and Avatar (−1.8% in 2009);[82] the second-best second weekend for an R-rated horror film after It ($60.1 million); and the third-best second weekend for Coogler after Black Panther ($111.6 million in 2018) and its sequel Wakanda Forever ($66.4 million in 2022). Deadline noted that the film's audience had broadened, with women making up 56% of patrons (up from 43% in the first weekend) and those under 25 comprising 34% (up from 20%).[78] The film also made $13.5 million over that frame from 71 foreign markets, a total attributed to word-of-mouth and strong holds in several countries.[83] After ceding its premium-large format and IMAX screens to newcomer Thunderbolts*, Sinners achieved the best third weekend for a horror film with $33 million (a 28% drop), topping It ($29.7 million).[84] Helped by \"exceptional holds\" in Latin America and Europe, it also made $10.4 million internationally over the weekend.[85] Sinners crossed $200 million domestically in its fourth weekend,[86] becoming the first original film to do so since Coco in 2017.[87] Critical response[edit] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 97% of 408 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"A rip-roaring fusion of masterful visual storytelling and toe-tapping music, writer-director Ryan Coogler's first original blockbuster reveals the full scope of his singular imagination.\"[88] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 84 out of 100, based on 55 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[89] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale (the highest grade for a horror film in 35 years), while those surveyed by PostTrak gave it a 92% overall positive score, with 84% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[67] Reviewers praised Coogler's vision and the film's cinematography; Rolling Stone critic A.A. Dowd commented that the director was \"swinging wide and far beyond the boundaries of franchise fare\", while Wendy Ide of The Observer wrote that \"Coogler's assurance and vision holds everything together.\"[90][91][92] Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post cited Coogler's \"impressive self-awareness\", as well as Jordan, Mosaku, and Caton's performances.[93] A number of critics suggested that the film's more grounded first half was superior to the supernaturally driven later acts.[94][95][96] Peter Travers of ABC News declared Sinners the best movie yet released in 2025, writing that it was Coogler and Jordan's \"best and most daring work yet\".[97] In a more negative review, The Wall Street Journal's Zachary Barnes praised Jordan's performance, but wrote that Sinners did not pull together thematically, arguing that \"Mr. Coogler's imagination remains limited by the conventions of Marveldom.\"[98] Sho Baraka of Christianity Today notes, \"Just be aware that ... the bawdy themes will tutor you in practices that would make your marriage counselor blush. ... Sinners does speak frankly about the bloodsucking perversion of religion in the United States. But the same plantation folks who suffered hypocrisy knew of a healer who gave joy [that] spawned spirituals, which gave birth to blues.\"[99] Several critics drew comparisons between the film and Robert Rodriguez's 1996 action-horror film From Dusk till Dawn.[100][101][102] Coogler cited From Dusk Till Dawn as an inspiration for the film, but compared it more to The Faculty, another film by Rodriguez.[103] The music of Sinners was widely praised by critics, who noted its centrality to the film's story. David Ehrlich of IndieWire wrote \"This isn't the first time that a Ludwig Göransson score has been inextricable from the texture of a Ryan Coogler movie, but Sinners opens with someone talking about a kind of music 'so pure it can pierce the veil between life and death, past and future'...and then proceeds to show us exactly what that sounds like.\"[104] Mae Abdulbaki of Screen Rant stated \"The music alone, from the songs played by the characters to the score by Ludwig Göransson, takes the film to another level.\"[105] Amy Nicholson of Los Angeles Times described the score as \"phenomenal\", adding it is music \"you've never heard and yet it seems to come from deep inside our pop-cultural soul.\"[7] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter described it as \"flavorful [...] with the score and the blues performances fusing together to intoxicating effect.\"[106] Barnes, of The Wall Street Journal, called Göransson's score \"a twangy marvel of genre-crossing interpolation\".[98] In June 2025, IndieWire ranked the film at number 65 on its list of \"The 100 Best Movies of the 2020s (So Far).\"[107] In July 2025, The Hollywood Reporter ranked it number 16 on its list of the \"25 Best Horror Movies of the 21st Century.\"[108] Accolades[edit] Accolades received by Sinners Award Date of ceremony Category Recipient(s) Result Ref.

        "content": "In 1932, identical twins and World War I veterans Elijah \"Smoke\" and Elias \"Stack\" Moore return to Clarksdale, Mississippi, having spent seven years working for the Chicago Outfit. Using money stolen from gangsters, they purchase a sawmill from landowner Hogwood to start a juke joint for the local Black community. Their cousin Sammie, an aspiring guitarist, joins them despite his pastor father Jedidiah's warnings about the sins of blues music. The twins recruit pianist Delta Slim as a performer, local Chinese shopkeeper couple Grace and Bo Chow as suppliers, field worker Cornbread as a bouncer, and Smoke's estranged wife Annie as a cook. Annie believes her Hoodoo practices kept the twins safe, but Smoke doubts them for not preventing their infant daughter's death. Stack runs into his white-passing ex-girlfriend Mary, who resents him for abandoning her out of protection. Elsewhere, Irish-immigrant vampire Remmick shelters from Choctaw vampire hunters with a married Klansmen couple, whom he turns into vampires. On the joint's opening night, Sammie, Delta Slim, and Pearline – a singer with whom Sammie becomes enamored – perform on stage. Sammie's music is transcendent, unknowingly summoning spirits of both past and future to join the crowd. However, the performance also attracts Remmick and his minions, who offer money and music in exchange for entry. A suspicious Smoke refuses. The twins realize that their patrons' reliance on company scrip makes it impossible for the joint to be profitable. Reasoning with Stack that outside income is necessary, Mary meets Remmick outside, but is bitten. Returning inside, she seduces and fatally bites Stack. Sammie and Smoke discover them; Smoke shoots Mary, but she is unaffected and escapes. Outside, Remmick turns Cornbread. Smoke closes the joint early; as the patrons and Bo leave, the vampires turn them. Stack revives as a vampire, but flees after Annie repels him with pickled garlic juice. Annie realizes their assailants are vampires and tells the survivors how to deter and defeat them and that killing Remmick will not revert the others back into humans. Although Remmick and his vampires share a hive mind, their personalities remain intact. Still unable to enter the joint, Remmick tries to negotiate by inviting the survivors to join him, saying that vampirism offers immortality and freedom from persecution. He promises to leave in exchange for Sammie, whose musical skills he wants to use to summon the spirits of his lost community, also revealing that Hogwood heads the local Klan and plans to attack the joint at dawn. They refuse, and Remmick threatens to attack the Chows' daughter Lisa at their home. Enraged by the threat, Grace invites the vampires into the joint, and a fight ensues. Grace, Bo, Annie, and Delta Slim are killed, while Mary escapes and Remmick turns Pearline. Smoke fights and defeats Stack, then stakes Remmick before he can bite Sammie. As the sun rises, the vampires are incinerated by its light. Smoke sends Sammie home before he kills Hogwood and his men, but is fatally shot. He reunites with Annie and their daughter after dying. Meanwhile, Sammie disregards his father's pleas to seek salvation and travels to Chicago. In 1992, an elderly Sammie, now a successful blues musician, is visited by an ageless Stack and Mary after performing at his blues club. Stack reveals that Smoke spared him at the joint on the condition that Sammie live in peace. After declining the couple's offer of immortality, Sammie performs for them. As they depart, Sammie admits that despite being haunted by that night, before the sun went down, it was the greatest day of his life. Stack wistfully agrees, as it was the last time he saw Smoke or the sun, and the only time they were all truly free. ",

        "content": "In January 2024, an untitled period film (rumored to take place in the Jim Crow-era South and involve the undead) from writer, director and producer Ryan Coogler was reported to be in development through his production company Proximity Media, with longtime collaborator Michael B. Jordan cast in the lead role.[15][16] Sony Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Universal Pictures were in a bidding war to acquire the distribution rights to the film, which carried a budget of around $90 million.[17] According to The Hollywood Reporter, Warner Bros. greenlit the film with a production budget of $80 million, but the final budget climbed to $100 million.[4] In exchange for the distribution rights to the film, Coogler was asking studios for first-dollar gross, final cut privilege, and ownership of the film twenty-five years after its release.[18] The following month, Warner Bros. won the distribution rights to the film by acceding to Coogler's terms.[16] Coogler cited the films of Quentin Tarantino, Jordan Peele, Christopher Nolan (who is given an on-screen special thanks credit), Francis Ford Coppola, Brian De Palma, Spike Lee and the Metallica song \"One\" as sources of inspiration.[19][20] In April 2024, Jack O'Connell was cast as the film's villain.[21] Delroy Lindo, Jayme Lawson, Omar Benson Miller, Hailee Steinfeld, Li Jun Li and Lola Kirke were cast in undisclosed roles.[22] Wunmi Mosaku was cast as Smoke's love interest.[23] Yao, Miles Caton, Peter Dreimanis, and Christian Robinson were added the next month.[24][25] Halsey would audition for the role that went to Steinfeld.[26] Machine Gun Kelly was offered the opportunity to audition for the role that went to Peter Dreimanis but he declined because he was not comfortable saying the n-word.[27] Principal photography began in New Orleans on April 14, 2024, under the working title Grilled Cheese, and wrapped on July 17.[28][29][30] It was shot by cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw on 65 mm film using a combination of IMAX 15-perf and Ultra Panavision 70 cameras[31] and scenes thus alternate between the 1.43:1 and 2.76:1 aspect ratios.[32][33][34] Kodak created a 65mm version of their Ektachrome 100D 5294 film stock specifically for the production, where it was used for a flashback sequence.[35] The production spent $67.6 million on-location in Louisiana.[36] The film's allocated budget was reported to have ultimately risen to around $100 million.[37][4] The film's production designer Hannah Beachler has acknowledged that the way the church in the film was designed included crossed beams that made the \"Wakanda Forever\" gesture and paid homage to the late Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman.[38][39] Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Storm Studios, Rising Sun Pictures, Base FX, Baraboom Studios, Light VFX and Outpost VFX provided the film's visual effects.[40][41] Some of the film's costumes were originally designed by Ruth E. Carter for the planned Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film Blade, but when production on it stalled Carter was approached by Coogler to work on the film. Given both films' shared time period and similar settings within the Prohibition era, Carter was able to reuse her research for Sinners and was allowed by Marvel Studios to buy costumes she made originally for Blade to be used on Sinners.[42] ",

        "content": "Coogler's frequent collaborator Ludwig Göransson worked on the soundtrack of Sinners.[43] Göransson described Sinners as a personal and ambitious score, reflecting his own musical journey.[44] He drew inspiration from blues music and performed the score on a 1932 Dobro Cyclops resonator guitar, the same one Sammie carries throughout the film.[43][45] During the pre-production, Coogler sent Göransson several recordings from the 1930s and 1940s, particularly those of Robert Johnson and Tommy Johnson.[46] Göransson and Coogler insisted that Ludwig's wife Serena produce the songs. Serena Göransson, a classically trained violinist, said the southern Black music had to be handled with care and expert consultation and that she felt \"like a steward with this project [...] especially with the music. I just feel that it has a life of its own...\"[43] The couple worked with Lawrence \"Boo\" Mitchell, a blues producer who owns Royal Studios, and visited the B.B. King Museum and local juke joints in Clarksdale and Indianola with him for inspiration. The Göranssons and Mitchell recorded the songs at Royal Studios over five days with musicians such as Alvin Youngblood Hart and Cedric Burnside.[46] Mitchell also brought in other blues musicians such as Brittany Howard, Raphael Saadiq, Bobby Rush, Christone \"Kingfish\" Ingram and Buddy Guy (who also appears in the film).[46][47] The Göranssons rented a studio converted from a church in New Orleans, and worked with the supporting cast of Jack O'Connell, Lola Kirke, Peter Dreimanis and Jayme Lawson, rehearsing their songs multiple times. Much of the film was recorded live on set, with the cast members performing alongside other blues musicians.[43] Hailee Steinfeld wrote and recorded the original song \"Dangerous\" for the film.[48] Unlike most Warner Bros. films, which have soundtracks released through the company's in-house label WaterTower Music or record labels owned by Warner Music Group, the soundtrack and score to Sinners were released through Sony Music labels.[45] The soundtrack was released on Sony Masterworks on April 18, 2025, the same day as the film,[49] featuring 22 tracks performed by an array of blues musicians, alongside the cast members.[50][51] The lead single \"Sinners,\" performed by Rod Wave, was released two weeks prior.[45][52] ",

It was previously scheduled for release on March 7, 2025, but was delayed to April (swapping dates with Mickey 17) to allow for more time needed in post-production due to the scarcity of film stock labs for the project, which heavily utilized film cameras.[53][54][55] In addition to a standard digital release, the film also received 10 IMAX 70 mm prints,[56][57] and 5 standard 70 mm prints.[58][59] In late May, the film was screened in Clarksdale, Mississippi, where it is set. Clarksdale does not have a working movie theater, but the civic auditorium hosted six showings, introduced by Coogler, Göransson, and other filmmakers. The town also hosted panels and Q&As related to the film over the three-day weekend festival.[60][61] AMC Theaters nationwide scheduled screenings of the film on Juneteenth at discounted prices.[62] ",

        "content": "As of July 22, 2025[update], Sinners has grossed $278.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $87.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $365.9 million.[5][6] Some publications said the film needed to gross $170–185 million to break-even when factoring in its production budget, Coogler's first-dollar gross, premium video-on-demand, and streaming deals with Prime and Netflix.[67][68] Other industry sources placed the break-even point at $200–225 million, with Puck going as high as $300 million, because of the film's budget, estimated $50–60 million marketing spend, and the presumption that theaters keep half of ticket sales.[69][70] Many fans of the film and industry figures like Ben Stiller criticized media coverage, specifically pieces from Variety, The New York Times, and Business Insider, that seemed to downplay the film's success by focusing on its box office performance, Coogler's salary, and speculation about its profitability.[71][72][73][74] In the United States and Canada, Sinners was projected to gross $30–40 million from 3,308 theaters in its opening weekend.[68][75] The film made $19.2 million on its first day, including an estimated $4.7 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $48 million, topping projections to finish first at the box office, upsetting Warner Bros.' own holdover A Minecraft Movie, which grossed $40.5 million in its third weekend.[67] The opening marked the best start for an original film since Jordan Peele's Us ($71 million in 2019), and the first time a studio had two films make more than $40 million each over a single weekend since 2009. Walk-up business, particularly on Saturday, and word-of-mouth contributed substantially to the opening, with 61% of attendees buying their ticket the same day.[67][76] Premium large format and IMAX screenings made up 45% of the opening.[77] Exit polling indicated that 47% of moviegoers bought tickets because of Jordan, 40% for Coogler, and 45% because of positive word-of-mouth, and that 64% of attendees were 35 or younger, with 46% being 25–34 and 2% under 18. The audience was 49% Black, 27% Caucasian, 14% Latino and Hispanic, 6% Asian, and 4% Native American/other, \"a strong turnout among different demographics\".[67][70][76][78] Sinners also made $15.4 million from 71 international markets, for a global opening weekend of $61 million.[79] Word-of-mouth momentum helped Sinners earn the second-best Monday haul for an R-rated horror film at $7.8 million, behind It ($8.6 million in 2017).[80] It ended its first week ahead of the seven-day totals of The Conjuring ($61.7 million in 2013) and Get Out ($49.8 million in 2017) with $77.5 million.[78] Sinners exceeded second weekend projections ($19.2–24 million)[81] to outgross new releases and top the box office again with $45.7 million. Its 4.9% drop is the third-best second-weekend performance for a film that debuted to more than $40 million after Shrek (+0.3% in 2001) and Avatar (−1.8% in 2009);[82] the second-best second weekend for an R-rated horror film after It ($60.1 million); and the third-best second weekend for Coogler after Black Panther ($111.6 million in 2018) and its sequel Wakanda Forever ($66.4 million in 2022). Deadline noted that the film's audience had broadened, with women making up 56% of patrons (up from 43% in the first weekend) and those under 25 comprising 34% (up from 20%).[78] The film also made $13.5 million over that frame from 71 foreign markets, a total attributed to word-of-mouth and strong holds in several countries.[83] After ceding its premium-large format and IMAX screens to newcomer Thunderbolts*, Sinners achieved the best third weekend for a horror film with $33 million (a 28% drop), topping It ($29.7 million).[84] Helped by \"exceptional holds\" in Latin America and Europe, it also made $10.4 million internationally over the weekend.[85] Sinners crossed $200 million domestically in its fourth weekend,[86] becoming the first original film to do so since Coco in 2017.[87] ",

        "content": "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 97% of 408 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"A rip-roaring fusion of masterful visual storytelling and toe-tapping music, writer-director Ryan Coogler's first original blockbuster reveals the full scope of his singular imagination.\"[88] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 84 out of 100, based on 55 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[89] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale (the highest grade for a horror film in 35 years), while those surveyed by PostTrak gave it a 92% overall positive score, with 84% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[67] Reviewers praised Coogler's vision and the film's cinematography; Rolling Stone critic A.A. Dowd commented that the director was \"swinging wide and far beyond the boundaries of franchise fare\", while Wendy Ide of The Observer wrote that \"Coogler's assurance and vision holds everything together.\"[90][91][92] Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post cited Coogler's \"impressive self-awareness\", as well as Jordan, Mosaku, and Caton's performances.[93] A number of critics suggested that the film's more grounded first half was superior to the supernaturally driven later acts.[94][95][96] Peter Travers of ABC News declared Sinners the best movie yet released in 2025, writing that it was Coogler and Jordan's \"best and most daring work yet\".[97] In a more negative review, The Wall Street Journal's Zachary Barnes praised Jordan's performance, but wrote that Sinners did not pull together thematically, arguing that \"Mr. Coogler's imagination remains limited by the conventions of Marveldom.\"[98]\nSho Baraka of Christianity Today notes, \"Just be aware that ... the bawdy themes will tutor you in practices that would make your marriage counselor blush. ... Sinners does speak frankly about the bloodsucking perversion of religion in the United States. But the same plantation folks who suffered hypocrisy knew of a healer who gave joy [that] spawned spirituals, which gave birth to blues.\"[99] Several critics drew comparisons between the film and Robert Rodriguez's 1996 action-horror film From Dusk till Dawn.[100][101][102] Coogler cited From Dusk Till Dawn as an inspiration for the film, but compared it more to The Faculty, another film by Rodriguez.[103] The music of Sinners was widely praised by critics, who noted its centrality to the film's story. David Ehrlich of IndieWire wrote \"This isn't the first time that a Ludwig Göransson score has been inextricable from the texture of a Ryan Coogler movie, but Sinners opens with someone talking about a kind of music 'so pure it can pierce the veil between life and death, past and future'...and then proceeds to show us exactly what that sounds like.\"[104] Mae Abdulbaki of Screen Rant stated \"The music alone, from the songs played by the characters to the score by Ludwig Göransson, takes the film to another level.\"[105] Amy Nicholson of Los Angeles Times described the score as \"phenomenal\", adding it is music \"you've never heard and yet it seems to come from deep inside our pop-cultural soul.\"[7] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter described it as \"flavorful [...] with the score and the blues performances fusing together to intoxicating effect.\"[106] Barnes, of The Wall Street Journal, called Göransson's score \"a twangy marvel of genre-crossing interpolation\".[98] In June 2025, IndieWire ranked the film at number 65 on its list of \"The 100 Best Movies of the 2020s (So Far).\"[107] In July 2025, The Hollywood Reporter ranked it number 16 on its list of the \"25 Best Horror Movies of the 21st Century.\"[108] ",

      "content": "Sinners is a 2025 American horror film[a] produced, written, and directed by Ryan Coogler.[10] Set in 1932 in the Mississippi Delta, the film stars Michael B. Jordan in dual roles as criminal twin brothers who return to their hometown where they are confronted by a supernatural evil. It co-stars Hailee Steinfeld, Miles Caton (in his film debut), Jack O'Connell, Wunmi Mosaku, Jayme Lawson, Omar Miller, and Delroy Lindo. Coogler began developing the film through his production company Proximity Media, with Jordan cast in the lead role. The project was announced in January 2024, and after a bidding war, Warner Bros. Pictures acquired distribution rights the following month. Additional roles were cast in April. Principal photography took place from April to July 2024. Longtime Coogler collaborator Ludwig Göransson composed the film's score and served as an executive producer. Sinners premiered on April 3, 2025, at AMC Lincoln Square in New York City,[11] and was theatrically released in United States on April 18, 2025, by Warner Bros. Pictures.[12] The film received critical acclaim and grossed $365.9 million worldwide. ",

          "content": "In 1932, identical twins and World War I veterans Elijah \"Smoke\" and Elias \"Stack\" Moore return to Clarksdale, Mississippi, having spent seven years working for the Chicago Outfit. Using money stolen from gangsters, they purchase a sawmill from landowner Hogwood to start a juke joint for the local Black community. Their cousin Sammie, an aspiring guitarist, joins them despite his pastor father Jedidiah's warnings about the sins of blues music. The twins recruit pianist Delta Slim as a performer, local Chinese shopkeeper couple Grace and Bo Chow as suppliers, field worker Cornbread as a bouncer, and Smoke's estranged wife Annie as a cook. Annie believes her Hoodoo practices kept the twins safe, but Smoke doubts them for not preventing their infant daughter's death. Stack runs into his white-passing ex-girlfriend Mary, who resents him for abandoning her out of protection. Elsewhere, Irish-immigrant vampire Remmick shelters from Choctaw vampire hunters with a married Klansmen couple, whom he turns into vampires. On the joint's opening night, Sammie, Delta Slim, and Pearline – a singer with whom Sammie becomes enamored – perform on stage. Sammie's music is transcendent, unknowingly summoning spirits of both past and future to join the crowd. However, the performance also attracts Remmick and his minions, who offer money and music in exchange for entry. A suspicious Smoke refuses. The twins realize that their patrons' reliance on company scrip makes it impossible for the joint to be profitable. Reasoning with Stack that outside income is necessary, Mary meets Remmick outside, but is bitten. Returning inside, she seduces and fatally bites Stack. Sammie and Smoke discover them; Smoke shoots Mary, but she is unaffected and escapes. Outside, Remmick turns Cornbread. Smoke closes the joint early; as the patrons and Bo leave, the vampires turn them. Stack revives as a vampire, but flees after Annie repels him with pickled garlic juice. Annie realizes their assailants are vampires and tells the survivors how to deter and defeat them and that killing Remmick will not revert the others back into humans. Although Remmick and his vampires share a hive mind, their personalities remain intact. Still unable to enter the joint, Remmick tries to negotiate by inviting the survivors to join him, saying that vampirism offers immortality and freedom from persecution. He promises to leave in exchange for Sammie, whose musical skills he wants to use to summon the spirits of his lost community, also revealing that Hogwood heads the local Klan and plans to attack the joint at dawn. They refuse, and Remmick threatens to attack the Chows' daughter Lisa at their home. Enraged by the threat, Grace invites the vampires into the joint, and a fight ensues. Grace, Bo, Annie, and Delta Slim are killed, while Mary escapes and Remmick turns Pearline. Smoke fights and defeats Stack, then stakes Remmick before he can bite Sammie. As the sun rises, the vampires are incinerated by its light. Smoke sends Sammie home before he kills Hogwood and his men, but is fatally shot. He reunites with Annie and their daughter after dying. Meanwhile, Sammie disregards his father's pleas to seek salvation and travels to Chicago. In 1992, an elderly Sammie, now a successful blues musician, is visited by an ageless Stack and Mary after performing at his blues club. Stack reveals that Smoke spared him at the joint on the condition that Sammie live in peace. After declining the couple's offer of immortality, Sammie performs for them. As they depart, Sammie admits that despite being haunted by that night, before the sun went down, it was the greatest day of his life. Stack wistfully agrees, as it was the last time he saw Smoke or the sun, and the only time they were all truly free. ",

          "content": "In January 2024, an untitled period film (rumored to take place in the Jim Crow-era South and involve the undead) from writer, director and producer Ryan Coogler was reported to be in development through his production company Proximity Media, with longtime collaborator Michael B. Jordan cast in the lead role.[15][16] Sony Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Universal Pictures were in a bidding war to acquire the distribution rights to the film, which carried a budget of around $90 million.[17] According to The Hollywood Reporter, Warner Bros. greenlit the film with a production budget of $80 million, but the final budget climbed to $100 million.[4] In exchange for the distribution rights to the film, Coogler was asking studios for first-dollar gross, final cut privilege, and ownership of the film twenty-five years after its release.[18] The following month, Warner Bros. won the distribution rights to the film by acceding to Coogler's terms.[16] Coogler cited the films of Quentin Tarantino, Jordan Peele, Christopher Nolan (who is given an on-screen special thanks credit), Francis Ford Coppola, Brian De Palma, Spike Lee and the Metallica song \"One\" as sources of inspiration.[19][20] In April 2024, Jack O'Connell was cast as the film's villain.[21] Delroy Lindo, Jayme Lawson, Omar Benson Miller, Hailee Steinfeld, Li Jun Li and Lola Kirke were cast in undisclosed roles.[22] Wunmi Mosaku was cast as Smoke's love interest.[23] Yao, Miles Caton, Peter Dreimanis, and Christian Robinson were added the next month.[24][25] Halsey would audition for the role that went to Steinfeld.[26] Machine Gun Kelly was offered the opportunity to audition for the role that went to Peter Dreimanis but he declined because he was not comfortable saying the n-word.[27] Principal photography began in New Orleans on April 14, 2024, under the working title Grilled Cheese, and wrapped on July 17.[28][29][30] It was shot by cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw on 65 mm film using a combination of IMAX 15-perf and Ultra Panavision 70 cameras[31] and scenes thus alternate between the 1.43:1 and 2.76:1 aspect ratios.[32][33][34] Kodak created a 65mm version of their Ektachrome 100D 5294 film stock specifically for the production, where it was used for a flashback sequence.[35] The production spent $67.6 million on-location in Louisiana.[36] The film's allocated budget was reported to have ultimately risen to around $100 million.[37][4] The film's production designer Hannah Beachler has acknowledged that the way the church in the film was designed included crossed beams that made the \"Wakanda Forever\" gesture and paid homage to the late Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman.[38][39] Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Storm Studios, Rising Sun Pictures, Base FX, Baraboom Studios, Light VFX and Outpost VFX provided the film's visual effects.[40][41] Some of the film's costumes were originally designed by Ruth E. Carter for the planned Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film Blade, but when production on it stalled Carter was approached by Coogler to work on the film. Given both films' shared time period and similar settings within the Prohibition era, Carter was able to reuse her research for Sinners and was allowed by Marvel Studios to buy costumes she made originally for Blade to be used on Sinners.[42] ",

              "content": "Coogler's frequent collaborator Ludwig Göransson worked on the soundtrack of Sinners.[43] Göransson described Sinners as a personal and ambitious score, reflecting his own musical journey.[44] He drew inspiration from blues music and performed the score on a 1932 Dobro Cyclops resonator guitar, the same one Sammie carries throughout the film.[43][45] During the pre-production, Coogler sent Göransson several recordings from the 1930s and 1940s, particularly those of Robert Johnson and Tommy Johnson.[46] Göransson and Coogler insisted that Ludwig's wife Serena produce the songs. Serena Göransson, a classically trained violinist, said the southern Black music had to be handled with care and expert consultation and that she felt \"like a steward with this project [...] especially with the music. I just feel that it has a life of its own...\"[43] The couple worked with Lawrence \"Boo\" Mitchell, a blues producer who owns Royal Studios, and visited the B.B. King Museum and local juke joints in Clarksdale and Indianola with him for inspiration. The Göranssons and Mitchell recorded the songs at Royal Studios over five days with musicians such as Alvin Youngblood Hart and Cedric Burnside.[46] Mitchell also brought in other blues musicians such as Brittany Howard, Raphael Saadiq, Bobby Rush, Christone \"Kingfish\" Ingram and Buddy Guy (who also appears in the film).[46][47] The Göranssons rented a studio converted from a church in New Orleans, and worked with the supporting cast of Jack O'Connell, Lola Kirke, Peter Dreimanis and Jayme Lawson, rehearsing their songs multiple times. Much of the film was recorded live on set, with the cast members performing alongside other blues musicians.[43] Hailee Steinfeld wrote and recorded the original song \"Dangerous\" for the film.[48] Unlike most Warner Bros. films, which have soundtracks released through the company's in-house label WaterTower Music or record labels owned by Warner Music Group, the soundtrack and score to Sinners were released through Sony Music labels.[45] The soundtrack was released on Sony Masterworks on April 18, 2025, the same day as the film,[49] featuring 22 tracks performed by an array of blues musicians, alongside the cast members.[50][51] The lead single \"Sinners,\" performed by Rod Wave, was released two weeks prior.[45][52] ",

It was previously scheduled for release on March 7, 2025, but was delayed to April (swapping dates with Mickey 17) to allow for more time needed in post-production due to the scarcity of film stock labs for the project, which heavily utilized film cameras.[53][54][55] In addition to a standard digital release, the film also received 10 IMAX 70 mm prints,[56][57] and 5 standard 70 mm prints.[58][59] In late May, the film was screened in Clarksdale, Mississippi, where it is set. Clarksdale does not have a working movie theater, but the civic auditorium hosted six showings, introduced by Coogler, Göransson, and other filmmakers. The town also hosted panels and Q&As related to the film over the three-day weekend festival.[60][61] AMC Theaters nationwide scheduled screenings of the film on Juneteenth at discounted prices.[62] ",

              "content": "As of July 22, 2025[update], Sinners has grossed $278.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $87.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $365.9 million.[5][6] Some publications said the film needed to gross $170–185 million to break-even when factoring in its production budget, Coogler's first-dollar gross, premium video-on-demand, and streaming deals with Prime and Netflix.[67][68] Other industry sources placed the break-even point at $200–225 million, with Puck going as high as $300 million, because of the film's budget, estimated $50–60 million marketing spend, and the presumption that theaters keep half of ticket sales.[69][70] Many fans of the film and industry figures like Ben Stiller criticized media coverage, specifically pieces from Variety, The New York Times, and Business Insider, that seemed to downplay the film's success by focusing on its box office performance, Coogler's salary, and speculation about its profitability.[71][72][73][74] In the United States and Canada, Sinners was projected to gross $30–40 million from 3,308 theaters in its opening weekend.[68][75] The film made $19.2 million on its first day, including an estimated $4.7 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $48 million, topping projections to finish first at the box office, upsetting Warner Bros.' own holdover A Minecraft Movie, which grossed $40.5 million in its third weekend.[67] The opening marked the best start for an original film since Jordan Peele's Us ($71 million in 2019), and the first time a studio had two films make more than $40 million each over a single weekend since 2009. Walk-up business, particularly on Saturday, and word-of-mouth contributed substantially to the opening, with 61% of attendees buying their ticket the same day.[67][76] Premium large format and IMAX screenings made up 45% of the opening.[77] Exit polling indicated that 47% of moviegoers bought tickets because of Jordan, 40% for Coogler, and 45% because of positive word-of-mouth, and that 64% of attendees were 35 or younger, with 46% being 25–34 and 2% under 18. The audience was 49% Black, 27% Caucasian, 14% Latino and Hispanic, 6% Asian, and 4% Native American/other, \"a strong turnout among different demographics\".[67][70][76][78] Sinners also made $15.4 million from 71 international markets, for a global opening weekend of $61 million.[79] Word-of-mouth momentum helped Sinners earn the second-best Monday haul for an R-rated horror film at $7.8 million, behind It ($8.6 million in 2017).[80] It ended its first week ahead of the seven-day totals of The Conjuring ($61.7 million in 2013) and Get Out ($49.8 million in 2017) with $77.5 million.[78] Sinners exceeded second weekend projections ($19.2–24 million)[81] to outgross new releases and top the box office again with $45.7 million. Its 4.9% drop is the third-best second-weekend performance for a film that debuted to more than $40 million after Shrek (+0.3% in 2001) and Avatar (−1.8% in 2009);[82] the second-best second weekend for an R-rated horror film after It ($60.1 million); and the third-best second weekend for Coogler after Black Panther ($111.6 million in 2018) and its sequel Wakanda Forever ($66.4 million in 2022). Deadline noted that the film's audience had broadened, with women making up 56% of patrons (up from 43% in the first weekend) and those under 25 comprising 34% (up from 20%).[78] The film also made $13.5 million over that frame from 71 foreign markets, a total attributed to word-of-mouth and strong holds in several countries.[83] After ceding its premium-large format and IMAX screens to newcomer Thunderbolts*, Sinners achieved the best third weekend for a horror film with $33 million (a 28% drop), topping It ($29.7 million).[84] Helped by \"exceptional holds\" in Latin America and Europe, it also made $10.4 million internationally over the weekend.[85] Sinners crossed $200 million domestically in its fourth weekend,[86] becoming the first original film to do so since Coco in 2017.[87] ",

              "content": "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 97% of 408 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"A rip-roaring fusion of masterful visual storytelling and toe-tapping music, writer-director Ryan Coogler's first original blockbuster reveals the full scope of his singular imagination.\"[88] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 84 out of 100, based on 55 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[89] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale (the highest grade for a horror film in 35 years), while those surveyed by PostTrak gave it a 92% overall positive score, with 84% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[67] Reviewers praised Coogler's vision and the film's cinematography; Rolling Stone critic A.A. Dowd commented that the director was \"swinging wide and far beyond the boundaries of franchise fare\", while Wendy Ide of The Observer wrote that \"Coogler's assurance and vision holds everything together.\"[90][91][92] Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post cited Coogler's \"impressive self-awareness\", as well as Jordan, Mosaku, and Caton's performances.[93] A number of critics suggested that the film's more grounded first half was superior to the supernaturally driven later acts.[94][95][96] Peter Travers of ABC News declared Sinners the best movie yet released in 2025, writing that it was Coogler and Jordan's \"best and most daring work yet\".[97] In a more negative review, The Wall Street Journal's Zachary Barnes praised Jordan's performance, but wrote that Sinners did not pull together thematically, arguing that \"Mr. Coogler's imagination remains limited by the conventions of Marveldom.\"[98]\nSho Baraka of Christianity Today notes, \"Just be aware that ... the bawdy themes will tutor you in practices that would make your marriage counselor blush. ... Sinners does speak frankly about the bloodsucking perversion of religion in the United States. But the same plantation folks who suffered hypocrisy knew of a healer who gave joy [that] spawned spirituals, which gave birth to blues.\"[99] Several critics drew comparisons between the film and Robert Rodriguez's 1996 action-horror film From Dusk till Dawn.[100][101][102] Coogler cited From Dusk Till Dawn as an inspiration for the film, but compared it more to The Faculty, another film by Rodriguez.[103] The music of Sinners was widely praised by critics, who noted its centrality to the film's story. David Ehrlich of IndieWire wrote \"This isn't the first time that a Ludwig Göransson score has been inextricable from the texture of a Ryan Coogler movie, but Sinners opens with someone talking about a kind of music 'so pure it can pierce the veil between life and death, past and future'...and then proceeds to show us exactly what that sounds like.\"[104] Mae Abdulbaki of Screen Rant stated \"The music alone, from the songs played by the characters to the score by Ludwig Göransson, takes the film to another level.\"[105] Amy Nicholson of Los Angeles Times described the score as \"phenomenal\", adding it is music \"you've never heard and yet it seems to come from deep inside our pop-cultural soul.\"[7] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter described it as \"flavorful [...] with the score and the blues performances fusing together to intoxicating effect.\"[106] Barnes, of The Wall Street Journal, called Göransson's score \"a twangy marvel of genre-crossing interpolation\".[98] In June 2025, IndieWire ranked the film at number 65 on its list of \"The 100 Best Movies of the 2020s (So Far).\"[107] In July 2025, The Hollywood Reporter ranked it number 16 on its list of the \"25 Best Horror Movies of the 21st Century.\"[108] ",

          "full_content": "In 1932, identical twins and World War I veterans Elijah \"Smoke\" and Elias \"Stack\" Moore return to Clarksdale, Mississippi, having spent seven years working for the Chicago Outfit. Using money stolen from gangsters, they purchase a sawmill from landowner Hogwood to start a juke joint for the local Black community. Their cousin Sammie, an aspiring guitarist, joins them despite his pastor father Jedidiah's warnings about the sins of blues music. The twins recruit pianist Delta Slim as a performer, local Chinese shopkeeper couple Grace and Bo Chow as suppliers, field worker Cornbread as a bouncer, and Smoke's estranged wife Annie as a cook. Annie believes her Hoodoo practices kept the twins safe, but Smoke doubts them for not preventing their infant daughter's death. Stack runs into his white-passing ex-girlfriend Mary, who resents him for abandoning her out of protection. Elsewhere, Irish-immigrant vampire Remmick shelters from Choctaw vampire hunters with a married Klansmen couple, whom he turns into vampires. On the joint's opening night, Sammie, Delta Slim, and Pearline – a singer with whom Sammie becomes enamored – perform on stage. Sammie's music is transcendent, unknowingly summoning spirits of both past and future to join the crowd. However, the performance also attracts Remmick and his minions, who offer money and music in exchange for entry. A suspicious Smoke refuses. The twins realize that their patrons' reliance on company scrip makes it impossible for the joint to be profitable. Reasoning with Stack that outside income is necessary, Mary meets Remmick outside, but is bitten. Returning inside, she seduces and fatally bites Stack. Sammie and Smoke discover them; Smoke shoots Mary, but she is unaffected and escapes. Outside, Remmick turns Cornbread. Smoke closes the joint early; as the patrons and Bo leave, the vampires turn them. Stack revives as a vampire, but flees after Annie repels him with pickled garlic juice. Annie realizes their assailants are vampires and tells the survivors how to deter and defeat them and that killing Remmick will not revert the others back into humans. Although Remmick and his vampires share a hive mind, their personalities remain intact. Still unable to enter the joint, Remmick tries to negotiate by inviting the survivors to join him, saying that vampirism offers immortality and freedom from persecution. He promises to leave in exchange for Sammie, whose musical skills he wants to use to summon the spirits of his lost community, also revealing that Hogwood heads the local Klan and plans to attack the joint at dawn. They refuse, and Remmick threatens to attack the Chows' daughter Lisa at their home. Enraged by the threat, Grace invites the vampires into the joint, and a fight ensues. Grace, Bo, Annie, and Delta Slim are killed, while Mary escapes and Remmick turns Pearline. Smoke fights and defeats Stack, then stakes Remmick before he can bite Sammie. As the sun rises, the vampires are incinerated by its light. Smoke sends Sammie home before he kills Hogwood and his men, but is fatally shot. He reunites with Annie and their daughter after dying. Meanwhile, Sammie disregards his father's pleas to seek salvation and travels to Chicago. In 1992, an elderly Sammie, now a successful blues musician, is visited by an ageless Stack and Mary after performing at his blues club. Stack reveals that Smoke spared him at the joint on the condition that Sammie live in peace. After declining the couple's offer of immortality, Sammie performs for them. As they depart, Sammie admits that despite being haunted by that night, before the sun went down, it was the greatest day of his life. Stack wistfully agrees, as it was the last time he saw Smoke or the sun, and the only time they were all truly free. ",

          "full_content": "In January 2024, an untitled period film (rumored to take place in the Jim Crow-era South and involve the undead) from writer, director and producer Ryan Coogler was reported to be in development through his production company Proximity Media, with longtime collaborator Michael B. Jordan cast in the lead role.[15][16] Sony Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Universal Pictures were in a bidding war to acquire the distribution rights to the film, which carried a budget of around $90 million.[17] According to The Hollywood Reporter, Warner Bros. greenlit the film with a production budget of $80 million, but the final budget climbed to $100 million.[4] In exchange for the distribution rights to the film, Coogler was asking studios for first-dollar gross, final cut privilege, and ownership of the film twenty-five years after its release.[18] The following month, Warner Bros. won the distribution rights to the film by acceding to Coogler's terms.[16] Coogler cited the films of Quentin Tarantino, Jordan Peele, Christopher Nolan (who is given an on-screen special thanks credit), Francis Ford Coppola, Brian De Palma, Spike Lee and the Metallica song \"One\" as sources of inspiration.[19][20] In April 2024, Jack O'Connell was cast as the film's villain.[21] Delroy Lindo, Jayme Lawson, Omar Benson Miller, Hailee Steinfeld, Li Jun Li and Lola Kirke were cast in undisclosed roles.[22] Wunmi Mosaku was cast as Smoke's love interest.[23] Yao, Miles Caton, Peter Dreimanis, and Christian Robinson were added the next month.[24][25] Halsey would audition for the role that went to Steinfeld.[26] Machine Gun Kelly was offered the opportunity to audition for the role that went to Peter Dreimanis but he declined because he was not comfortable saying the n-word.[27] Principal photography began in New Orleans on April 14, 2024, under the working title Grilled Cheese, and wrapped on July 17.[28][29][30] It was shot by cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw on 65 mm film using a combination of IMAX 15-perf and Ultra Panavision 70 cameras[31] and scenes thus alternate between the 1.43:1 and 2.76:1 aspect ratios.[32][33][34] Kodak created a 65mm version of their Ektachrome 100D 5294 film stock specifically for the production, where it was used for a flashback sequence.[35] The production spent $67.6 million on-location in Louisiana.[36] The film's allocated budget was reported to have ultimately risen to around $100 million.[37][4] The film's production designer Hannah Beachler has acknowledged that the way the church in the film was designed included crossed beams that made the \"Wakanda Forever\" gesture and paid homage to the late Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman.[38][39] Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Storm Studios, Rising Sun Pictures, Base FX, Baraboom Studios, Light VFX and Outpost VFX provided the film's visual effects.[40][41] Some of the film's costumes were originally designed by Ruth E. Carter for the planned Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film Blade, but when production on it stalled Carter was approached by Coogler to work on the film. Given both films' shared time period and similar settings within the Prohibition era, Carter was able to reuse her research for Sinners and was allowed by Marvel Studios to buy costumes she made originally for Blade to be used on Sinners.[42] ",

          "full_content": "Coogler's frequent collaborator Ludwig Göransson worked on the soundtrack of Sinners.[43] Göransson described Sinners as a personal and ambitious score, reflecting his own musical journey.[44] He drew inspiration from blues music and performed the score on a 1932 Dobro Cyclops resonator guitar, the same one Sammie carries throughout the film.[43][45] During the pre-production, Coogler sent Göransson several recordings from the 1930s and 1940s, particularly those of Robert Johnson and Tommy Johnson.[46] Göransson and Coogler insisted that Ludwig's wife Serena produce the songs. Serena Göransson, a classically trained violinist, said the southern Black music had to be handled with care and expert consultation and that she felt \"like a steward with this project [...] especially with the music. I just feel that it has a life of its own...\"[43] The couple worked with Lawrence \"Boo\" Mitchell, a blues producer who owns Royal Studios, and visited the B.B. King Museum and local juke joints in Clarksdale and Indianola with him for inspiration. The Göranssons and Mitchell recorded the songs at Royal Studios over five days with musicians such as Alvin Youngblood Hart and Cedric Burnside.[46] Mitchell also brought in other blues musicians such as Brittany Howard, Raphael Saadiq, Bobby Rush, Christone \"Kingfish\" Ingram and Buddy Guy (who also appears in the film).[46][47] The Göranssons rented a studio converted from a church in New Orleans, and worked with the supporting cast of Jack O'Connell, Lola Kirke, Peter Dreimanis and Jayme Lawson, rehearsing their songs multiple times. Much of the film was recorded live on set, with the cast members performing alongside other blues musicians.[43] Hailee Steinfeld wrote and recorded the original song \"Dangerous\" for the film.[48] Unlike most Warner Bros. films, which have soundtracks released through the company's in-house label WaterTower Music or record labels owned by Warner Music Group, the soundtrack and score to Sinners were released through Sony Music labels.[45] The soundtrack was released on Sony Masterworks on April 18, 2025, the same day as the film,[49] featuring 22 tracks performed by an array of blues musicians, alongside the cast members.[50][51] The lead single \"Sinners,\" performed by Rod Wave, was released two weeks prior.[45][52] ",

It was previously scheduled for release on March 7, 2025, but was delayed to April (swapping dates with Mickey 17) to allow for more time needed in post-production due to the scarcity of film stock labs for the project, which heavily utilized film cameras.[53][54][55] In addition to a standard digital release, the film also received 10 IMAX 70 mm prints,[56][57] and 5 standard 70 mm prints.[58][59] In late May, the film was screened in Clarksdale, Mississippi, where it is set. Clarksdale does not have a working movie theater, but the civic auditorium hosted six showings, introduced by Coogler, Göransson, and other filmmakers. The town also hosted panels and Q&As related to the film over the three-day weekend festival.[60][61] AMC Theaters nationwide scheduled screenings of the film on Juneteenth at discounted prices.[62] ",

          "full_content": "As of July 22, 2025[update], Sinners has grossed $278.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $87.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $365.9 million.[5][6] Some publications said the film needed to gross $170–185 million to break-even when factoring in its production budget, Coogler's first-dollar gross, premium video-on-demand, and streaming deals with Prime and Netflix.[67][68] Other industry sources placed the break-even point at $200–225 million, with Puck going as high as $300 million, because of the film's budget, estimated $50–60 million marketing spend, and the presumption that theaters keep half of ticket sales.[69][70] Many fans of the film and industry figures like Ben Stiller criticized media coverage, specifically pieces from Variety, The New York Times, and Business Insider, that seemed to downplay the film's success by focusing on its box office performance, Coogler's salary, and speculation about its profitability.[71][72][73][74] In the United States and Canada, Sinners was projected to gross $30–40 million from 3,308 theaters in its opening weekend.[68][75] The film made $19.2 million on its first day, including an estimated $4.7 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $48 million, topping projections to finish first at the box office, upsetting Warner Bros.' own holdover A Minecraft Movie, which grossed $40.5 million in its third weekend.[67] The opening marked the best start for an original film since Jordan Peele's Us ($71 million in 2019), and the first time a studio had two films make more than $40 million each over a single weekend since 2009. Walk-up business, particularly on Saturday, and word-of-mouth contributed substantially to the opening, with 61% of attendees buying their ticket the same day.[67][76] Premium large format and IMAX screenings made up 45% of the opening.[77] Exit polling indicated that 47% of moviegoers bought tickets because of Jordan, 40% for Coogler, and 45% because of positive word-of-mouth, and that 64% of attendees were 35 or younger, with 46% being 25–34 and 2% under 18. The audience was 49% Black, 27% Caucasian, 14% Latino and Hispanic, 6% Asian, and 4% Native American/other, \"a strong turnout among different demographics\".[67][70][76][78] Sinners also made $15.4 million from 71 international markets, for a global opening weekend of $61 million.[79] Word-of-mouth momentum helped Sinners earn the second-best Monday haul for an R-rated horror film at $7.8 million, behind It ($8.6 million in 2017).[80] It ended its first week ahead of the seven-day totals of The Conjuring ($61.7 million in 2013) and Get Out ($49.8 million in 2017) with $77.5 million.[78] Sinners exceeded second weekend projections ($19.2–24 million)[81] to outgross new releases and top the box office again with $45.7 million. Its 4.9% drop is the third-best second-weekend performance for a film that debuted to more than $40 million after Shrek (+0.3% in 2001) and Avatar (−1.8% in 2009);[82] the second-best second weekend for an R-rated horror film after It ($60.1 million); and the third-best second weekend for Coogler after Black Panther ($111.6 million in 2018) and its sequel Wakanda Forever ($66.4 million in 2022). Deadline noted that the film's audience had broadened, with women making up 56% of patrons (up from 43% in the first weekend) and those under 25 comprising 34% (up from 20%).[78] The film also made $13.5 million over that frame from 71 foreign markets, a total attributed to word-of-mouth and strong holds in several countries.[83] After ceding its premium-large format and IMAX screens to newcomer Thunderbolts*, Sinners achieved the best third weekend for a horror film with $33 million (a 28% drop), topping It ($29.7 million).[84] Helped by \"exceptional holds\" in Latin America and Europe, it also made $10.4 million internationally over the weekend.[85] Sinners crossed $200 million domestically in its fourth weekend,[86] becoming the first original film to do so since Coco in 2017.[87] ",

The website's consensus reads: \"A rip-roaring fusion of masterful visual storytelling and toe-tapping music, writer-director Ryan Coogler's first original blockbuster reveals the full scope of his singular imagination.\"[88] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 84 out of 100, based on 55 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[89] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale (the highest grade for a horror film in 35 years), while those surveyed by PostTrak gave it a 92% overall positive score, with 84% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[67] Reviewers praised Coogler's vision and the film's cinematography; Rolling Stone critic A.A. Dowd commented that the director was \"swinging wide and far beyond the boundaries of franchise fare\", while Wendy Ide of The Observer wrote that \"Coogler's assurance and vision holds everything together.\"[90][91][92] Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post cited Coogler's \"impressive self-awareness\", as well as Jordan, Mosaku, and Caton's performances.[93] A number of critics suggested that the film's more grounded first half was superior to the supernaturally driven later acts.[94][95][96] Peter Travers of ABC News declared Sinners the best movie yet released in 2025, writing that it was Coogler and Jordan's \"best and most daring work yet\".[97] In a more negative review, The Wall Street Journal's Zachary Barnes praised Jordan's performance, but wrote that Sinners did not pull together thematically, arguing that \"Mr. Coogler's imagination remains limited by the conventions of Marveldom.\"[98]\nSho Baraka of Christianity Today notes, \"Just be aware that ... the bawdy themes will tutor you in practices that would make your marriage counselor blush. ... Sinners does speak frankly about the bloodsucking perversion of religion in the United States. But the same plantation folks who suffered hypocrisy knew of a healer who gave joy [that] spawned spirituals, which gave birth to blues.\"[99] Several critics drew comparisons between the film and Robert Rodriguez's 1996 action-horror film From Dusk till Dawn.[100][101][102] Coogler cited From Dusk Till Dawn as an inspiration for the film, but compared it more to The Faculty, another film by Rodriguez.[103] The music of Sinners was widely praised by critics, who noted its centrality to the film's story. David Ehrlich of IndieWire wrote \"This isn't the first time that a Ludwig Göransson score has been inextricable from the texture of a Ryan Coogler movie, but Sinners opens with someone talking about a kind of music 'so pure it can pierce the veil between life and death, past and future'...and then proceeds to show us exactly what that sounds like.\"[104] Mae Abdulbaki of Screen Rant stated \"The music alone, from the songs played by the characters to the score by Ludwig Göransson, takes the film to another level.\"[105] Amy Nicholson of Los Angeles Times described the score as \"phenomenal\", adding it is music \"you've never heard and yet it seems to come from deep inside our pop-cultural soul.\"[7] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter described it as \"flavorful [...] with the score and the blues performances fusing together to intoxicating effect.\"[106] Barnes, of The Wall Street Journal, called Göransson's score \"a twangy marvel of genre-crossing interpolation\".[98] In June 2025, IndieWire ranked the film at number 65 on its list of \"The 100 Best Movies of the 2020s (So Far).\"[107] In July 2025, The Hollywood Reporter ranked it number 16 on its list of the \"25 Best Horror Movies of the 21st Century.\"[108] ",
